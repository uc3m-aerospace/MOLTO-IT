   MICE_SRFXPT computes the surface intercept point of a specified ray
   on a target body at a specified epoch, optionally corrected for light
   time and stellar aberration, given an observer and a direction vector
   defining a ray.

   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the routine
   <a href="cspice_sincpt.html">cspice_sincpt</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of
   backward compatibility only.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      method   a string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to use.

               [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

               The only currently supported choice:

                  &quot;Ellipsoid&quot;   The intercept computation uses
                                a triaxial ellipsoid to model
                                the surface of the target body.
                                The ellipsoid's radii must be
                                available in the kernel pool.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               'method'.

      target   the name of the target body. The target body is an
               ephemeris object (its trajectory is given by SPK data),
               and is an extended object. Optionally, you may supply the
               integer ID code for the object as an integer string, i.e.
               both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that indicate
               the Moon is the target body.

               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

      et       the ephemeris time(s), expressed as seconds past J2000
               TDB, at which to compute the surface intercept point on
               the target body (this epoch represents either the time of
               signal reception, or transmission, depending on the
               selected 'abcorr')

               [1,n] = size(et); double = class(et)

      abcorr   the aberration correction to apply when computing the
               observer-target state and the target body orientation.

               [1,c3] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               For practical purposes, 'CN' (converged Newtonian)
               represents the best correction choice.

               'abcorr' may be any of the following:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction. Return the
                             geometric surface intercept point on the
                             target body.

               Let 'lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the surface intercept point (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center).
               The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;reception&quot; case in which photons depart from the
               intercept point's location at the light-time
               corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the observer's
               location at 'et':


                  'LT'       Correct for one-way light time (also
                             called &quot;planetary aberration&quot;) using a
                             Newtonian formulation. This correction
                             yields the location of the surface
                             intercept point at the moment it
                             emitted photons arriving at the
                             observer at 'et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  'LT+S'     Correct for one-way light time and
                             stellar aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This option modifies the
                             state obtained with the 'LT' option to
                             account for the observer's velocity
                             relative to the solar system
                             barycenter. The result is the apparent
                             surface intercept point as seen by the
                             observer.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction.  In solving the light time
                             equation, the 'CN' correction iterates
                             until the solution converges. Both the
                             state and rotation of the target body
                             are corrected for light time.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time
                             and stellar aberration corrections.

               The following values of 'abcorr' apply to the
               &quot;transmission&quot; case in which photons *depart* from
               the observer's location at 'et' and arrive at the
               intercept point at the light-time corrected epoch
               et+lt:

                  'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation. This correction yields the
                             intercept location at the moment it
                             receives photons emitted from the
                             observer's location at 'et'.

                             The light time correction uses an
                             iterative solution of the light time
                             equation. The solution invoked by the
                             'LT' option uses one iteration.

                             Both the target state as seen by the
                             observer, and rotation of the target
                             body, are corrected for light time.

                  'XLT+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation  This option modifies the
                             intercept obtained with the 'XLT'
                             option to account for the observer's
                             velocity relative to the solar system
                             barycenter.

                  'XCN'      Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction.  This is the same as 'XLT'
                             correction but with further iterations
                             to a converged Newtonian light time
                             solution.

                  'XCN+S'    &quot;Transmission&quot; case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

      obsrvr   the name of a observing body. Optionally, you may supply
               the integer ID code for the object as an integer string,
               i.e. both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate strings that
               indicate the Moon is the observing body.

               [1,c4] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

      dref     the name of the reference frame relative to which the
               input direction vector is expressed. This may be any
               frame supported by the SPICE system, including built-in
               frames (documented in the Frames Required Reading) and
               frames defined by a loaded frame kernel (FK).

               [1,c5] = size(dref); char = class(dref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(dref); cell = class(dref)

               When 'dref' designates a non-inertial frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at an epoch
               dependent on the frame's center and, if the center is
               not the observer, on the selected aberration
               correction. See the description of the direction
               vector 'dvec' for details.

      dvec     Pointing vector emanating from the observer.  The
               intercept with the target body's surface of the ray
               defined by the observer and 'dvec' is sought.

               [3,1] = size(dvec); double = class(dvec)

               'dvec' is specified relative to the reference frame
               designated by 'dref'.

               Non-inertial reference frames are treated as follows:
               if the center of the frame is at the observer's
               location, the frame is evaluated at 'et'.  If the
               frame's center is located elsewhere, then letting
               'ltcent' be the one-way light time between the observer
               and the central body associated with the frame, the
               orientation of the frame is evaluated at et-ltcent,
               et+ltcent, or 'et' depending on whether the requested
               aberration correction is, respectively, for received
               radiation, transmitted radiation, or is omitted.
               'ltcent' is computed using the method indicated by
               'abcorr'.

   the call:

      [surf] = <b>mice_srfxpt</b>( method, target, et, abcorr, obsrvr, dref, dvec)

   returns:

      surf   the structure(s) containing the results of the calculation.

              [1,n] = size(surf); struct = class(surf)

              Each structure consists of the fields:

                spoint   the surface intercept point on the target body of
                         the ray defined by the observer and the direction
                         vector. If the ray intersects the target body in
                         multiple points, the selected intersection point is
                         the one closest to the observer.  The output
                         argument 'found' (see below) indicates whether an
                         intercept was found.

                         [3,1] = size(surf(i).spoint)
                         double = class(surf(i).spoint)

                         'spoint' is expressed in Cartesian coordinates,
                         relative to the body-fixed frame associated with the
                         target body.  The body-fixed target frame is
                         evaluated at the intercept epoch 'trgepc' (see
                         description below).

                         When light time correction is used, the duration of
                         light travel between 'spoint' to the observer is
                         considered to be the one way light time.  When both
                         light time and stellar aberration corrections are
                         used, 'spoint' is selected such that, when 'spoint'
                         is corrected for light time and the vector from the
                         observer to the light-time corrected location of
                         'spoint' is corrected for stellar aberration, the
                         resulting vector is parallel to the ray defined by
                         the observer's location and 'dvec'.

                         The components of 'spoint' are given in units of km.

               dist      the distance between the observer and the surface
                         intercept on the target body. 'dist' is given in
                         units of km.

                         [1,1] = size(surf(i).dist)
                         double = class(surf(i).dist)

               trgepc    the &quot;intercept epoch.&quot;  This is the epoch at which
                         the ray defined by 'obsrvr' and 'dvec' intercepts the
                         target surface at 'spoint'.  'trgepc' is defined as
                         follows: letting 'lt' be the one-way light time
                         between the observer and the intercept point,
                         'trgepc' is the epoch et-lt, et+lt, or 'et' depending
                         on whether the requested aberration correction is,
                         respectively, for received radiation, transmitted
                         radiation, or omitted. 'lt' is computed using the
                         method indicated by 'abcorr'.

                         [1,1] = size(surf(i).trgepc)
                         double = class(surf(i).trgepc)

                         'trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

               obspos    the vector from the center of the target body at
                         epoch 'trgepc' to the observer at epoch 'et'.
                         'obspos' is expressed in the target body-fixed
                         reference frame evaluated at 'trgepc'.  (This is
                         the frame relative to which 'spoint' is given.)

                         'obspos' is returned to simplify various related
                         computations that would otherwise be cumbersome. For
                         example, the vector 'xvec' from the observer to
                         'spoint' can be calculated via

                            xvec = spoint - obspos

                         The components of 'obspos' are given in units of km.

               found     the logical flag indicating whether or not the ray
                         intersects the target.  If an intersection exists
                         'found' will be returned as true. If the ray misses
                         the target, 'found' will return as false.

                         [1,1] = size(surf(i).found)
                         logical = class(surf(i).found)

      'surf' return with the same vectorization measure, N, as 'et'.
