   CSPICE_ILLUMF computes the illumination angles---phase, incidence,
   and emission---at a specified point on a target body. Return logical
   flags indicating whether the surface point is visible from
   the observer's position and whether the surface point is
   illuminated.

   The target body's surface is represented using topographic data
   provided by DSK files, or by a reference ellipsoid.

   The illumination source is a specified ephemeris object.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      method   is a short string providing parameters defining
               the computation method to be used. In the syntax
               descriptions below, items delimited by brackets
               are optional.

               [1,c1] = size(method); char = class(method)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(method); cell = class(method)

               `method' may be assigned the following values:

                  'ELLIPSOID'

                     The illumination angle computation uses a
                     triaxial ellipsoid to model the surface of the
                     target body. The ellipsoid's radii must be
                     available in the kernel pool.


                  'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED[/SURFACES = &lt;surface list&gt;]'

                     The illumination angle computation uses
                     topographic data to model the surface of the
                     target body. These data must be provided by
                     loaded DSK files.

                     The surface list specification is optional. The
                     syntax of the list is

                        &lt;surface 1&gt; [, &lt;surface 2&gt;...]

                     If present, it indicates that data only for the
                     listed surfaces are to be used; however, data
                     need not be available for all surfaces in the
                     list. If absent, loaded DSK data for any surface
                     associated with the target body are used.

                     The surface list may contain surface names or
                     surface ID codes. Names containing blanks must
                     be delimited by double quotes, for example

                        'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

                     If multiple surfaces are specified, their names
                     or IDs must be separated by commas.

                     See the Particulars section below for details
                     concerning use of DSK data.


               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `method', except within double-quoted strings
               representing surface names. For example, the string
               ' eLLipsoid ' is valid.

               Within double-quoted strings representing surface names,
               blank characters are significant, but multiple
               consecutive blanks are considered equivalent to a single
               blank. Case is not significant. So

                  &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;

               is equivalent to

                  &quot; mars megdr  128  pixel/deg &quot;

               but not to

                  &quot;MARS MEGDR128PIXEL/DEG&quot;

      target   is the name of the target body. `target' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `target' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
               legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
               target body.

               [1,c2] = size(target); char = class(target)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(target); cell = class(target)

      ilusrc   is the name of the illumination source. This source
               may be any ephemeris object. Case, blanks, and
               numeric values are treated in the same way as for the
               input `target'.

               [1,c3] = size(ilusrc); char = class(ilusrc)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(ilusrc); cell = class(ilusrc)

      et       is the epoch, expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB,
               for which the apparent illumination angles at the
               specified surface point on the target body, as seen
               from the observing body, are to be computed.

               [1,1] = size(et); double = class(et)

      fixref   is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered
               reference frame associated with the target body. The
               input surface point `spoint' and the output vector
               `srfvec' are expressed relative to this reference
               frame. The string `fixref' is case-insensitive, and
               leading and trailing blanks in `fixref' are not
               significant.

               [1,c4] = size(fixref); char = class(fixref)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(fixref); cell = class(fixref)

      abcorr   is the aberration correction to be used in computing
               the position and orientation of the target body and
               the location of the illumination source.

               [1,c5] = size(abcorr); char = class(abcorr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(abcorr); cell = class(abcorr)

               For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
               illumination angles seen by the observer are desired,
               normally either of the corrections

                  'LT+S'
                  'CN+S'

               should be used. These and the other supported options
               are described below. `abcorr' may be any of the
               following:

                  'NONE'     No aberration correction.

               Let `lt' represent the one-way light time between the
               observer and the input surface point `spoint' (note: NOT
               between the observer and the target body's center). The
               following values of `abcorr' apply to the &quot;reception&quot;
               case in which photons depart from `spoint' at the
               light-time corrected epoch et-lt and *arrive* at the
               observer's location at `et':

                  'LT'       Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position
                             of the illumination source as seen by
                             the target, for light time.

                  'LT+S'     Correct both the position of `spoint' as
                             seen by the observer, and the position
                             of the illumination source as seen by
                             the target, for light time and stellar
                             aberration.

                  'CN'       Converged Newtonian light time
                             correction. In solving the light time
                             equations for `spoint' and the
                             illumination source, the 'CN'
                             correction iterates until the solution
                             converges.

                  'CN+S'     Converged Newtonian light time and
                             stellar aberration corrections. This
                             option produces a solution that is at
                             least as accurate at that obtainable
                             with the 'LT+S' option. Whether the
                             'CN+S' solution is substantially more
                             accurate depends on the geometry of the
                             participating objects and on the
                             accuracy of the input data. In all
                             cases this routine will execute more
                             slowly when a converged solution is
                             computed.

               Neither case nor white space are significant in
               `abcorr'. For example, the string

                 'Lt + s'

               is valid.

      obsrvr   is the name of the observing body. The observing body
               is an ephemeris object: it typically is a spacecraft,
               the earth, or a surface point on the earth. `obsrvr' is
               case-insensitive, and leading and trailing blanks in
               `obsrvr' are not significant. Optionally, you may
               supply a string containing the integer ID code for
               the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are
               legitimate strings that indicate the moon is the
               observer.

               [1,c6] = size(obsrvr); char = class(obsrvr)

                  or

               [1,1] = size(obsrvr); cell = class(obsrvr)

               `obsrvr' may be not be identical to `target'.

      spoint   is a surface point on the target body, expressed in
               Cartesian coordinates, relative to the body-fixed
               target frame designated by `fixref'.

               [3,1] = size(spoint); double = class(spoint)

               `spoint' need not be visible from the observer's
               location at the epoch `et'.

               The components of `spoint' have units of km.

   the call:

      [trgepc, srfvec, phase, solar, emissn, visibl, lit] = ...
                                          <b>cspice_illumf</b>( method, ...

                                          abcorr, obsrvr, spoint

   returns:

      trgepc   is the &quot;target surface point epoch.&quot; `trgepc' is defined
               as follows: letting `lt' be the one-way light time
               between the observer and the input surface point
               `spoint', `trgepc' is either the epoch et-lt or `et'
               depending on whether the requested aberration correction
               is, respectively, for received radiation or omitted.
               `lt' is computed using the method indicated by `abcorr'.

               [1,1] = size(trgepc); double = class(trgepc)

               'trgepc' is expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB.

      srfvec   is the vector from the observer's position at `et' to
               the aberration-corrected (or optionally, geometric)
               position of `spoint', where the aberration corrections
               are specified by `abcorr'. `srfvec' is expressed in the
               target body-fixed reference frame designated by
               `fixref', evaluated at `trgepc'.

               [3,1] = size(srfvec); double = class(srfvec)

               The components of `srfvec' are given in units of km.

               One can use the function norm to obtain the
               distance between the observer and `spoint':

                  dist = norm( srfvec );

               The observer's position `obspos', relative to the
               target body's center, where the center's position is
               corrected for aberration effects as indicated by
               `abcorr', can be computed with:

                  obspos = spoint - srfvec

               To transform the vector `srfvec' from a reference frame
               `fixref' at time `trgepc' to a time-dependent reference
               frame `ref' at time `et', the routine <a href="cspice_pxfrm2.html">cspice_pxfrm2</a> should be
               called. Let `xform' be the 3x3 matrix representing the
               rotation from the reference frame `fixref' at time
               `trgepc' to the reference frame `ref' at time `et'. Then
               `srfvec' can be transformed to the result `refvec' as
               follows:

                     xform  = <a href="cspice_pxfrm2.html">cspice_pxfrm2</a> ( fixref, ref, trgepc, et )
                     refvec = xform * srfvec

      phase    is the phase angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr' at
               time `et'. This is the angle between the spoint-obsrvr
               vector and the spoint-illumination source vector. Units
               are radians. The range of `phase' is [0, pi]. See
               Particulars below for a detailed discussion of the
               definition.

               [1,1] = size(incdnc); double = class(incdnc)

      incdnc   is the illumination source incidence angle at `spoint',
               as seen from `obsrvr' at time `et'. This is the angle
               between the surface normal vector at `spoint' and the
               spoint-illumination source vector. Units are radians.
               The range of `incdnce' is [0, pi]. See Particulars below
               for a detailed discussion of the definition.

               [1,1] = size(solar); double = class(solar)

      emissn   is the emission angle at `spoint', as seen from `obsrvr'
               at time `et'. This is the angle between the surface
               normal vector at `spoint' and the spoint-observer
               vector. Units are radians. The range of `emissn' is [0,
               pi]. See Particulars below for a detailed discussion of
               the definition.

               [1,1] = size(emissn); double = class(emissn)

      visibl   is a logical flag indicating whether the surface
               point is visible to the observer. `visibl' takes into
               account whether the target surface occults `spoint',
               regardless of the emission angle at `spoint'. `visibl' is
               returned with the value true if `spoint' is visible;
               otherwise it is false.

               [1,1] = size(visibl); logical = class(visibl)

      lit      is a logical flag indicating whether the surface
               point is illuminated; the point is considered to be
               illuminated if the vector from the point to the
               center of the illumination source doesn't intersect
               the target surface. `lit' takes into account whether
               the target surface casts a shadow on `spoint',
               regardless of the incidence angle at `spoint'. `lit' is
               returned with the value true if `spoint' is
               illuminated; otherwise it is false.

   Any numerical results shown for this example may differ between
   platforms as the results depend on the SPICE kernels used as input
   and the machine specific arithmetic implementation.

   Example(1):

      Find the phase, solar incidence, and emission angles at the
      sub-solar and sub-spacecraft points on Mars as seen from the Mars
      Global Surveyor spacecraft at a specified UTC time.

      Use both an ellipsoidal Mars shape model and topographic data
      provided by a DSK file.  For both surface points, use the 'near
      point' and 'nadir' definitions for ellipsoidal and DSK shape
      models, respectively.

      Use converged Newtonian light time and stellar aberration
      corrections.

      The topographic model is based on data from the MGS MOLA DEM
      megr90n000cb, which has a resolution of 4 pixels/degree. A
      triangular plate model was produced by computing a 720 x 1440
      grid of interpolated heights from this DEM, then tessellating
      the height grid. The plate model is stored in a type 2 segment
      in the referenced DSK file.

   Illumination angles
   ===================

   The term &quot;illumination angles&quot; refers to the following set of
   angles:


      phase angle              Angle between the vectors from the
                               surface point to the observer and
                               from the surface point to the
                               illumination source.

      incidence angle          Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               illumination source.

      emission angle           Angle between the surface normal at
                               the specified surface point and the
                               vector from the surface point to the
                               observer.

   The diagram below illustrates the geometric relationships
   defining these angles. The labels for the incidence, emission,
   and phase angles are &quot;inc.&quot;, &quot;e.&quot;, and &quot;phase&quot;.


                                                    *
                                            illumination source

                            ._                 _.
                            |\                 /|  illumination
                              \    phase      /    source vector
                               \   .    .    /
                               .            .
                                 \   ___   /
                            .     \/     \/
                                  _\ inc./
                           .    /   \   /
                           .   |  e. \ /
       *             &lt;--------------- *  surface point on
    viewing            vector            target body
    location           to viewing
    (observer)         location


   Note that if the target-observer vector, the target normal vector
   at the surface point, and the target-illumination source vector
   are coplanar, then phase is the sum of the incidence and emission
   angles. This rarely occurs; usually

      phase angle  &lt;  incidence angle + emission angle

   All of the above angles can be computed using light time
   corrections, light time and stellar aberration corrections, or no
   aberration corrections. In order to describe apparent geometry as
   observed by a remote sensing instrument, both light time and
   stellar aberration corrections should be used.

   The way aberration corrections are applied by this routine
   is described below.

         Let `et' be the epoch at which an observation or remote
         sensing measurement is made, and let et-lt (&quot;lt&quot; stands
         for &quot;light time&quot;) be the epoch at which the photons
         received at `et' were emitted from the surface point `spoint'.
         Note that the light time between the surface point and
         observer will generally differ from the light time between
         the target body's center and the observer.


         Target body's orientation
         -------------------------

         Using the definitions of `et' and `lt' above, the target body's
         orientation at et-lt is used. The surface normal is
         dependent on the target body's orientation, so the body's
         orientation model must be evaluated for the correct epoch.


         Target body -- illumination source vector
         -----------------------------------------

         The surface features on the target body near `spoint' will
         appear in a measurement made at `et' as they were at et-lt.
         In particular, lighting on the target body is dependent on
         the apparent location of the illumination source as seen
         from the target body at et-lt. So, a second light time
         correction is used to compute the position of the
         illumination source relative to the surface point.


      Stellar aberration corrections
      ==============================

      Stellar aberration corrections are applied only if
      light time corrections are applied as well.

         Observer-target surface point body vector
         -----------------------------------------

         When stellar aberration correction is performed, the
         direction vector `srfvec' is adjusted so as to point to the
         apparent position of `spoint': considering `spoint' to be an
         ephemeris object, `srfvec' points from the observer's
         position at `et' to the light time and stellar aberration
         corrected position of `spoint'.

         Target body-illumination source vector
         --------------------------------------

         The target body-illumination source vector is the apparent
         position of the illumination source, corrected for light
         time and stellar aberration, as seen from the target body
         at time et-lt.


   Using DSK data
   ==============

      DSK loading and unloading
      -------------------------

      DSK files providing data used by this routine are loaded by
      calling <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> and can be unloaded by calling <a href="cspice_unload.html">cspice_unload</a> or
      <a href="cspice_kclear.html">cspice_kclear</a>. See the documentation of <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a> for limits on
      numbers of loaded DSK files.

      For run-time efficiency, it's desirable to avoid frequent
      loading and unloading of DSK files. When there is a reason to
      use multiple versions of data for a given target body---for
      example, if topographic data at varying resolutions are to be
      used---the surface list can be used to select DSK data to be
      used for a given computation. It is not necessary to unload
      the data that are not to be used. This recommendation presumes
      that DSKs containing different versions of surface data for a
      given body have different surface ID codes.


      DSK data priority
      -----------------

      A DSK coverage overlap occurs when two segments in loaded DSK
      files cover part or all of the same domain---for example, a
      given longitude-latitude rectangle---and when the time
      intervals of the segments overlap as well.

      When DSK data selection is prioritized, in case of a coverage
      overlap, if the two competing segments are in different DSK
      files, the segment in the DSK file loaded last takes
      precedence. If the two segments are in the same file, the
      segment located closer to the end of the file takes
      precedence.

      When DSK data selection is unprioritized, data from competing
      segments are combined. For example, if two competing segments
      both represent a surface as a set of triangular plates, the
      union of those sets of plates is considered to represent the
      surface.

      Currently only unprioritized data selection is supported.
      Because prioritized data selection may be the default behavior
      in a later version of the routine, the UNPRIORITIZED keyword is
      required in the `method' argument.


      Syntax of the `method' input argument
      -----------------------------------

      The keywords and surface list in the `method' argument
      are called &quot;clauses.&quot; The clauses may appear in any
      order, for example

         'DSK/&lt;surface list&gt;/UNPRIORITIZED'
         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;'
         'UNPRIORITIZED/&lt;surface list&gt;/DSK'

      The simplest form of the `method' argument specifying use of
      DSK data is one that lacks a surface list, for example:

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED'

      For applications in which all loaded DSK data for the target
      body are for a single surface, and there are no competing
      segments, the above string suffices. This is expected to be
      the usual case.

      When, for the specified target body, there are loaded DSK
      files providing data for multiple surfaces for that body, the
      surfaces to be used by this routine for a given call must be
      specified in a surface list, unless data from all of the
      surfaces are to be used together.

      The surface list consists of the string

         'SURFACES ='

      followed by a comma-separated list of one or more surface
      identifiers. The identifiers may be names or integer codes in
      string format. For example, suppose we have the surface
      names and corresponding ID codes shown below:

         Surface Name                              ID code
         ------------                              -------
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                1
         &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;                 2
         &quot;Mars_MRO_HIRISE&quot;                         3

      If data for all of the above surfaces are loaded, then
      data for surface 1 can be specified by either

         'SURFACES = 1'

      or

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 128 PIXEL/DEG&quot;'

      Double quotes are used to delimit the surface name
      because it contains blank characters.

      To use data for surfaces 2 and 3 together, any
      of the following surface lists could be used:

         'SURFACES = 2, 3'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR  64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'

         'SURFACES = 2, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

         'SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, Mars_MRO_HIRISE'

      An example of a `method' argument that could be constructed
      using one of the surface lists above is

         'DSK/UNPRIORITIZED/SURFACES = &quot;Mars MEGDR 64 PIXEL/DEG&quot;, 3'


      Aberration corrections using DSK data
      -------------------------------------

      For irregularly shaped target bodies, the distance between the
      observer and the nearest surface intercept need not be a
      continuous function of time; hence the one-way light time
      between the intercept and the observer may be discontinuous as
      well. In such cases, the computed light time, which is found
      using an iterative algorithm, may converge slowly or not at all.
      In all cases, the light time computation will terminate, but
      the result may be less accurate than expected.
